# skillcrush_python_gui

### Repo showcasing two simple and fun SkillCrush Python Gui projects

* Language Translation App using Python and Remi
  * Translates 2000 unique English Language words to Spanish and French
  * This was a project to practice file processing w/CSV files and integrating Python code with Remi gui.  Much was skeleton code but fun to try out Remi for the first time!

* Personal Assistant App
  * Allows users to add, remove, and get todo's, birthdays, and contacts.
  * Similar to above project, practice for file processing in Python and an introduction to Remi for gui development.
